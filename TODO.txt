TODO:

- Use stb_load to load images into htmlCode
  Try to see if strcat works then.
  If it doesn't then we will need to add the httpResponseHeader and the image data in htmlCode into a file using
  the write function and then read from that file and send that data to the browser.

======================================================== 
- OTHER IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!
- Try to use memcpy instead of strcat since it will not stop at the null terminator.
  (will need to play around so that it starts appending at the end of the file, or could
   add image data into the response string first and then add the header information at 
   the start of the string).

- Parse http request to see what they want
- FAVICONS!!!
- Be able to send images
- Be able to setup routes
- PUT requests
