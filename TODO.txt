TODO:

* PUT requests
  * store data.
  * parse PUT request for escape characters.


- Support the `Connection: keep-alive` flag  by specifying the `Content-Length` flag (allows for multiple send() calls since the browser knows how much
  data will be sent) -> this will need multithreading to handle multiple clients.
- Make server logs easier to read and add colour
- Abstract sockets methods so that we can support Windows and Linux.
- Add SSL/TLS encryption.
- Logging data to the database.
