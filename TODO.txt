TODO:

- Support sending videos

* PUT requests
  * Support DELETE, PUT (basically update I think)
  * Get rid of the hideous code in the HTTP_ParsePOSTRequest and move over to 
    storing the data in a database.
 
* In HTTP_ParseGETRequest if we are asked to send the data back in json we will 
  return all the global variables and variables defined in the route (the variables
  defined in the route should override matching global variables).

* We will need to need to implement local variables for each route in the database
e.g. DATABASE LAYOUT:
TABLE NAME (THE ROUTE) -> FILE AT ROUTE, (OPTIONAL) LOCAL VARIABLES

* Be able to send and receive and store data in json.

- Make it so that we can change the value of variables which only exist on another
  webpage and only send that webpage when the user wants it (in other words don'that
  return the data at the POST request route if it does not match the route it is 
  currently in).

* Make it so that any variables which do not have a definition are automatically
  removed from data_to_send.



- Support the `Connection: keep-alive` flag  by specifying the `Content-Length` flag (allows for multiple send() calls since the browser knows how much
  data will be sent) -> this will need multithreading to handle multiple clients.
- Make server logs easier to read and add colour
- Abstract sockets methods so that we can support Windows and Linux.
- Add SSL/TLS encryption.
- Logging data to the database.
- Add some security checks to make sure that the message being sent is actually a 
  HTTP request.
